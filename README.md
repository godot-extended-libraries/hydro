Hydro is a module for Godot 3.2 which allows rigid bodies to behave realistically in water.

For installation and usage instructions, read the [wiki](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/hydro/wiki).

To see the module in action, try out the included demo or check out the [showcase](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/hydro/wiki/showcase).

Looking for volunteers to help. Documentation, coding and general feedback.
